[AexPy](https://github.com/StardustDL/aexpy) */eɪkspaɪ/* is **A**pi **EX**plorer in **PY**thon for detecting API breaking changes in Python packages.

Explore AexPy's [APIs](https://aexpy.netlify.app/projects/aexpy), and the [main](https://aexpy.netlify.app/view/?url=https://stardustdl.github.io/aexpy/main.json) branch on **AexPy** itself. AexPy also runs an [index project](https://github.com/StardustDL-Labs/aexpy-index) for some packages shown [here](https://aexpy.netlify.app/), trying to replace `pypi.org` to `aexpy.netlify.app` in the package PyPI URLs to explore their APIs.

AexPy also provides a framework to process Python packages, extract APIs, and detect changes, which is designed for easily reusing and customizing. See the following "Advanced Tools" section and the source code for details.

## Quick Start

Take the package [generator-oj-problem](https://pypi.org/project/generator-oj-problem/) v0.0.1 and v0.0.2 as an example.

- Save API descriptions to `cache/api1.json` and `cache/api2.json`
- Output report to `report.txt`

```sh
# Install AexPy package and tool
pip install aexpy

# Extract APIs from v0.0.1
echo generator-oj-problem@0.0.1 | aexpy extract - api1.json -r

# Extract APIs from v0.0.1
echo generator-oj-problem@0.0.2 | aexpy extract - api2.json -r

# Diff APIs between two versions
aexpy diff api1.json api2.json changes.json
```

  - Generate portable data in JSON for API descriptions, changes, and so on.
  - Execute processing and view data by AexPy's command-line, with stdin/stdout supported.

## Install

We provide the Python package on PyPI. Use pip to install the package.

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade aexpy
aexpy --help
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure your Python interpreter works in [UTF-8 mode](https://peps.python.org/pep-0540/).

We also provide the Docker image to avoid environment errors.

```sh
docker pull stardustdl/aexpy:latest
docker run --rm stardustdl/aexpy:latest --help

# or the image from the main branch
docker pull stardustdl/aexpy:main
```

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> - AexPy match commands by their prefixes, so you do not need to write the whole command name, but just a distinguishable prefix.
>   ```sh
>   # aexpy preprocess --help
>   aexpy pre --help
>   ```
> - All results produced by AexPy are in JSON format, so you could modify it in any text editor.
> - Pass `-` to I/O arguments to use stdin/stdout.


### Preprocess

Preprocess a distribution for a package release.

AexPy provide four preprocessing modes:

- `-s`, `--src`: (default) Use given distribution information (path to code, package name, modules)
- `-r`, `--release`: download and unpack the package wheel and automatically load from dist-info
- `-w`, `--wheel`: Unpack existing package wheel file and automatically load from dist-info
- `-d`, `--dist`: Automatically load from unpacked wheel, and its dist-info

AexPy will automatically load package name, version, top-level modules, and dependencies from dist-info.

There are also options to specify fields in the distribution:

- `-p`, `--project`: Package name and its version, e.g. `project@version`.
- `-m`, `--module`: (multiple) Top-level module names.
- `-D`, `--depends`: (multiple) Package dependencies.
- `-R`, `--requirements`: Package `requirements.txt` file path, to load dependencies.
- `-P`, `--pyversion`: Specify Python version for this distribution, supported Python 3.8+.

> [!TIP]
> You could modify the generated distribution file in a text editor to change field values.

```sh
# download the package wheel and unpack into ./cache
# output the distribution file to ./cache/distribution.json
aexpy preprocess -r -p generator-oj-problem@0.0.1 ./cache ./cache/distribution.json
# or output the distribution file to stdout
aexpy preprocess -r -p generator-oj-problem@0.0.1 ./cache -

# use existing wheel file
aexpy preprocess -w ./cache/generator_oj_problem-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl ./cache/distribution.json

# use existing unpacked wheel directory, auto load metadata from .dist-info directory
aexpy preprocess -d ./cache/generator_oj_problem-0.0.1-py3-none-any ./cache/distribution.json

# use existing source code directory, given the package's name, version, and top-level modules
aexpy preprocess ./cache/generator_oj_problem-0.0.1-py3-none-any ./cache/distribution.json -p generator-oj-problem@0.0.1 -m generator_oj_problem
```

### Extract

Extract the API description from a distribution.

AexPy provide four modes for the input distribution file:

- `-j`, `--json`: (default) The file is the JSON file produced by AexPy (`preprocess` command)
- `-r`, `--release`: The file is a text containing the release ID, e.g., `aexpy@0.1.0`
- `-w`, `--wheel`: The file is a wheel, i.e., `.whl` file. when reading from stdin, please also give the wheel file name through `--wheel-name` option.
- `-s`, `--src`: The file is a ZIP file that contains the package code directory
  - Please ensure the directory is at the root of the ZIP archive

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **About Dependencies**
> AexPy would dynamically import the target module to detect all available APIs. So please ensure all dependencies have been installed in the extraction environment, or specify the `dependencies` field in the distribution, and AexPy will install them into the extraction environment.
> 
> If the `wheelFile` field is valid (i.e. the target file exists), AexPy will firstly try to install the wheel and ignore the `dependencies` field (used when the wheel installation fails).

> [!TIP]
> **About Environment**
> AexPy use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) as default environment manager. Use `AEXPY_ENV_PROVIDER` environment variable to specify `conda`, `mamba`, or `micromamba` (if the variable hasn't been specified, AexPy will detect the environment manager automatically).
> 
> - Use flag `--no-temp` to let AexPy use the current Python environment (as same as AexPy) as the extraction environment (the default behavior of the installed AexPy package).
> - Use flag `--temp` to let AexPy create a temporary mamba(conda) environment that matches the distribution's pyverion field (the default behavior of our docker image).
> - Use option `-e`, `--env` to specify an existing mamba(conda) env name as the extraction environment (will ignore the temp flag).

```sh
aexpy extract ./cache/distribution.json ./cache/api.json
# or input the distribution file from stdin
# (this feature is also supported in other commands)
aexpy extract - ./cache/api.json
# or output the api description file to stdout
aexpy extract ./cache/distribution.json -

# extract from the target project release
echo aexpy@0.0.1 | aexpy extract - api.json -r
# extract from the wheel file
aexpy extract ./temp/aexpy-0.1.0.whl api.json -w
cat ./temp/aexpy-0.1.0.whl | aexpy extract - api.json -w --wheel-name aexpy-0.1.0.whl
# extract from the project source code ZIP archive
zip -r - ./project | aexpy extract - api.json -s

# Use a env named demo-env
aexpy extract ./cache/distribution.json - -e demo-env
# Create a temporary env
aexpy extract ./cache/distribution.json - --temp
```

### Diff

Diff two API descriptions and detect changes.

```sh
aexpy diff ./cache/api1.json ./cache/api2.json ./cache/diff.json
```

> View results at [AexPy Online](https://aexpy.netlify.app/projects/generator-oj-problem/0.0.1..0.0.2/).

> [!TIP]
> If you have both stdin for OLD and NEW, please split two API descriptions by a comma `,`.
> 
> This situation only support for normal IO mode, not compressing IO mode.
> ```sh
> echo "," | cat ./api1.json - ./api2.json | aexpy diff - - ./changes.json
> ```

### Report

Generate report from detect changes.

```sh
aexpy report ./cache/diff.json ./cache/report.json
```

> View results at [AexPy Online](https://aexpy.netlify.app/projects/generator-oj-problem/0.0.1&0.0.2/).

### View

View produced data.

```sh
aexpy view ./cache/distribution1.json
aexpy view ./cache/distribution2.json
aexpy view ./cache/api1.json
aexpy view ./cache/api2.json
aexpy view ./cache/diff.json
aexpy view ./cache/report.json
```

### Docker Image

The docker image keeps the same command-line interface, but always use stdin/stdout for host-container data transferring.

```sh
echo generator-oj-problem@0.0.1 | docker run -i aexpy/aexpy extract - - > ./api.json

echo "," | cat ./api1.json - ./api2.json | docker run -i aexpy/aexpy diff - - - > ./changes.json
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to write processed data to filesystem, not the standard IO, add a volume mapping to `/data` for file access.
> 
> Please ensure using the same user as the owner of the mounted directory, to access mounted files.
> 
> ```sh
> docker run -v $pwd/cache:/data -u $(id -u):$(id -g) aexpy/aexpy extract /data/distribution.json /data/api.json
> ```

When you installed AexPy package, you could use `tool runimage` command for a quick runner of containers (if you have Docker installed).

> [!TIP]
> The volume directory will mount to `/data` in the container
> 
> All file path arguments passed to container should use absolute paths with `/data` prefix or use a path relative to `/data`.

```sh
# Use the same version of the image as current AexPy version
# Use current as mount directory
aexpy tool runimage -- --version
aexpy runimage -- --version

# Extract from ./dist.json
aexpy runimage -- extract ./dist.json ./api.json

# Use a specified image tag and mount directory
aexpy tool runimage -v ./mount -t stardustdl/aexpy:latest -- --version

# Extract from ./mount/dist.json
aexpy runimage -v ./mount -- extract ./dist.json ./api.json
aexpy runimage -v ./mount -- extract /data/dist.json /data/api.json
```

## Advanced Tools

### Logging

The processing may cost time, you can use multiple `-v` for verbose logs (which are outputed to stderr).

```sh
aexpy -vvv view ./cache/report.json
```

### Compressed IO

When the package is large, the JSON data produced by AexPy might be large, too. AexPy support gzip format to compress/decompress for IO streams, use `-z/--gzip` option or `AEXPY_GZIP_IO` environemnt variable to enable it.

```sh
aexpy --gzip extract ./cache/distribution.json ./cache/api.json.gz
AEXPY_GZIP_IO=1 aexpy extract ./cache/distribution.json.gz ./cache/api.json
aexpy view ./cache/api.json.gz
```

> [!TIP]
> AexPy will detect input file format automatically, no matter compressed-IO enabled or not.
> 
> When enabling compressed-IO mode, all output JSON streams will be regarded as gzip JSON streams.

### Interactive

Add `-i` or `--interact` to enable interactive mode, every command will create an interactive Python shell after finishing processing. Here are some useful variable you could use in the interactive Python shell.

- `result`: The produced data object
- `context`: The producing context, use `exception` to access the exception if failing to process

```sh
aexpy -i view ./cache/report.json
```

> [!TIP]
> Feel free to use `locals()` and `dir()` to explore the interactive environment.

### Statistics

AexPy provides tools to count numbers from produced data in `aexpy.tools.stats` module.
It loads products from given files, runs builtin counters, and then records them as kay-value pairs of the release (or release pair).

```sh
aexpy tool stat ./*.json ./stats.json
aexpy stat ./*.json ./stats.json

aexpy view ./stats.json
```

### Pipeline

AexPy has four loosely-coupled stages in its pipeline. The adjacent stages transfer data by JSON, defined in [models](https://github.com/StardustDL/aexpy/blob/main/src/aexpy/models/) directory. You can easily write your own implementation for every stage, and combine your implementation into the pipeline.

To write your own services, copy from [aexpy/services.py](https://github.com/StardustDL/aexpy/blob/main/src/aexpy/services.py) and write your subclass of `ServiceProvider` and modify the `getService` function to return your service instance.

```python
from aexpy.services import ServiceProvider

class MyServiceProvider(ServiceProvider):
    ...

def getService():
    return MyServiceProvider()
```

Then you can load your service file by `-s/--service` option or `AEXPY_SERVICE` environment variable.

```sh
aexpy -s services.py -vvv view --help
AEXPY_SERVICE=services.py aexpy -vvv view --help
```

We have implemented an image service provider, which replaces the default extractor, differ, and reporter by the container worker. See [aexpy/tools/workers/services.py](https://github.com/StardustDL/aexpy/blob/main/src/aexpy/tools/workers/services.py) for its implementation. Here is the demo service file to use the image service provider.

```python
from aexpy.tools.workers.services import DockerWorkerServiceProvider


def getService():
    return DockerWorkerServiceProvider(tag="stardustdl/aexpy:latest")
```
